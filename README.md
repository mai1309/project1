Project 1 for Systems Programming


Please use Linux system to run this project. Errors you see from Vscode are from the lack of Linux/Unix operating systems Eveything works as of this commit. To run, I used wsl in VS code.

Use this to compile:
gcc main.c file_system.c -o run -lpthread

Use this to run:
./run
